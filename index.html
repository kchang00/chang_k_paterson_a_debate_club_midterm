            <h3>Why Use an Umbrella</h3>
                <p>
                    The main purpose of umbrellas and raincoats are to keep you dry in the rain. But raincoats may not even fulfill this basic requirement. 
                    <br>
                    What if your rain coat doesn't have a hood? Then your head will get wet. Even if it has a hood? Things around you get wet. This could include your backpack containing important papers and your precious laptop.
                    <br>
                    With an umbrella, you, your head, and anything in your surrounding area stay dry. Invite a friend under your umbrella and share the warm, dry, and cozy environment!

            <h3>Variety</h3>
                <p>
                    Umbrellas come in all colours, shapes, and sizes. There are blue sports umbrellas to polka-dot compact umbrellas. Or clear umbrellas for better visibility. Whatever your style, there is an umbrella for you.
