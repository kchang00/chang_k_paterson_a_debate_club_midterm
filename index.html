        			Raincoats are legit because they have different lengths to cover your pants and shoes. Yes!!!

                    The main purpose of umbrellas and raincoats are to keep you dry in the rain. But raincoats may not even fulfill this basic requirement. 
                    <br>
                    What if your rain coat doesn't have a hood? Then your head will get wet. Even if it has a hood? Things around you get wet. This could include your backpack containing important papers and your precious laptop.
                    <br>
                    With an umbrella, you, your head, and anything in your surrounding area stay dry. Invite a friend under your umbrella and share the warm, dry, and cozy environment!

                    Umbrellas come in all colours, shapes, and sizes. There are blue sports umbrellas to polka-dot compact umbrellas. Or clear umbrellas for better visibility. Whatever your style, there is an umbrella for you.
